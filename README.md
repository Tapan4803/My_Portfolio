# WEB222 Final Project
I have built a portfolio website for my WEB222 Final Project as a second semester student at Seneca College.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

The website has been hosted using GitHub pages itself and you can access it [here](https://aryank1511.github.io/WEB222-Final-Project/) and the walkthrough video is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/oejeqPt4Sh8).

# Disclaimer
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
